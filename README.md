# File Permissions in Linux

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the use of Linux commands to check and modify file and directory permissions, ensuring that only authorized users have access. The `ls -la` command is used to analyze current permissions, and the `chmod` command is applied when necessary to correct them. The project focuses on managing permissions for both visible and hidden files, as well as restricting access to sensitive directories.
